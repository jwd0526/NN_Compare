## Experiment Overview

This experiment systematically compares how ANNs and SNNs perform on temporal pattern recognition tasks. The focus is specifically on revealing the inherent advantages of each architecture, with a theoretical expectation that SNNs would excel at processing time-dependent data due to their temporal dynamics, while ANNs might be more efficient for spatial pattern recognition.

### Core Objectives:
- Quantify performance differences between ANNs and SNNs on identical temporal datasets
- Measure convergence rates and training efficiency
- Evaluate robustness to noise and temporal jitter
- Identify specific temporal pattern types where each architecture excels

## Model Architectures

### Spiking Neural Network (SNN)

The SNN implementation uses a biologically-inspired architecture with temporal integration and spiking mechanisms:

```python
class SyntheticSpikeModel(SyntheticSNN):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, length, batch_size, 
                 tau_m=4.0, tau_s=1.0, dropout_rate=0.3):
        super().__init__(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, length, batch_size, tau_m, tau_s)
        
        # Adjust time constants for different layers
        tau_m_input = tau_m * 0.8  # Faster membrane dynamics
        tau_s_input = tau_s * 0.7  # Faster synaptic dynamics 
        tau_m_hidden = tau_m * 1.2  # Slower for information integration
        tau_s_hidden = tau_s * 1.0
        
        # First layer - temporal feature extraction
        self.axon1 = dual_exp_iir_layer((input_size,), self.length, self.batch_size, 
                                        tau_m_input, tau_s_input, True)
        self.snn1 = neuron_layer(input_size, hidden_size, self.length, self.batch_size, 
                                tau_m_input, True, True)
        
        # Intermediate layer with larger size for representation
        hidden_size_larger = int(hidden_size * 1.5)
        self.axon2 = dual_exp_iir_layer((hidden_size,), self.length, self.batch_size, 
                                       tau_m_hidden, tau_s_hidden, True)
        self.snn2 = neuron_layer(hidden_size, hidden_size_larger, self.length, 
                                self.batch_size, tau_m_hidden, True, True)
        
        # Additional hidden layer for deeper processing
        self.axon2b = dual_exp_iir_layer((hidden_size_larger,), self.length, 
                                        self.batch_size, tau_m_hidden, tau_s_hidden, True)
        self.snn2b = neuron_layer(hidden_size_larger, hidden_size, self.length, 
                                 self.batch_size, tau_m_hidden, True, True)
        
        # Output layer with standard dynamics
        self.axon3 = dual_exp_iir_layer((hidden_size,), self.length, self.batch_size, 
                                       tau_m, tau_s, True)
        self.snn3 = neuron_layer(hidden_size, output_size, self.length, self.batch_size, 
                                tau_m, True, False)
        
        # Adaptive dropout rates
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(p=dropout_rate * 0.7)
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(p=dropout_rate)
        self.dropout3 = nn.Dropout(p=dropout_rate * 1.2)
```

Key SNN components include:
- **Dual exponential synaptic model**: Combines fast and slow synaptic dynamics
- **Spiking neuron layer**: Implements leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with trainable membrane time constants
- **Multiple time constants**: Different layers use different time constants for multi-scale temporal processing
- **Residual connections**: Help with vanishing gradient problems in deeper networks

SNN configuration parameters:
- Batch size: 48
- Hidden layer size: 192
- Membrane time constant (tau_m): 4.0
- Synaptic time constant (tau_s): 1.2
- Dropout rate: 0.25

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

To ensure fair comparison, the ANN was deliberately simplified to focus on inherent architectural differences:

```python
class SyntheticANN(SyntheticANN):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, length, batch_size, 
                 dropout_rate=0.3):
        super().__init__(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, length, batch_size)
        
        # Store model parameters
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.output_size = output_size
        self.length = length
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.dropout_rate = dropout_rate
        
        # Simple classifier with batch normalization
        self.classifier = SimpleClassifier(
            input_size=input_size,
            hidden_size=hidden_size,
            output_size=output_size,
            dropout_rate=dropout_rate
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # If input is 3D [batch, neurons, time], take the sum over time
        if len(x.shape) == 3:
            x = torch.sum(x, dim=2)  # [batch, neurons]
        
        # Handle input size mismatch with padding/truncation
        batch_size = x.shape[0]
        if x.shape[1] != self.input_size:
            if x.shape[1] > self.input_size:
                x = x[:, :self.input_size]  # Truncate
            else:
                # Pad
                padded = torch.zeros(batch_size, self.input_size, device=x.device)
                padded[:, :x.shape[1]] = x
                x = padded
                
        # Forward pass through classifier
        output = self.classifier(x)
        return output
```

The SimpleClassifier used within the ANN:

```python
class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, dropout_rate=0.5):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout_rate)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(input_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```

ANN configuration parameters:
- Batch size: 24 (smaller to prevent overfitting)
- Hidden layer size: 64 (significantly smaller than SNN)
- Dropout rate: 0.5 (higher than SNN for regularization)
- Early stopping patience: 7 epochs

## Temporal Dataset Generation

The experiment uses three tiers of synthetic temporal datasets with progressively increasing difficulty:

```python
# Tier 1 patterns with 5% noise (increased from 2%)
noise_mask = np.random.random(tier1_patterns.shape) < 0.05
tier1_patterns[noise_mask] = 1.0
```

```python
# Tier 2 patterns with 12% noise (increased from 8%)
noise_mask = np.random.random(tier2_patterns.shape) < 0.12
tier2_patterns[noise_mask] = 1.0
```

### Tier 3: Complex Temporal Patterns
- **Description**: Highly similar patterns with subtle timing differences
- **Noise level**: 22% random spike insertion
- **Classes**: 3 different subtle pattern types
- **Expected challenge**: Detecting fine-grained temporal features with high noise
- **Pattern generation code**:
```python
# Tier 3 patterns with 22% noise (increased from 15%)
noise_mask = np.random.random(tier3_patterns.shape) < 0.22
tier3_patterns[noise_mask] = 1.0
```

Each dataset consists of:

    spike_count = torch.sum(output, dim=2)
    loss = criterion(spike_count, target.long())

## Convergence Analysis

A key focus of the experiment is analyzing how quickly each model type converges on temporal data. The metrics specifically track epochs required to reach four accuracy thresholds:

- 50% accuracy (basic learning)
- 65% accuracy (intermediate learning)
- 80% accuracy (good performance)
- 90% accuracy (high performance)

The visualization code implementing this analysis:

```python
# Define convergence thresholds
thresholds = [0.5, 0.65, 0.8, 0.9]
ann_epochs_to_converge = []
snn_epochs_to_converge = []

# Find first epoch where accuracy exceeds threshold
for threshold in thresholds:
    try:
        # For ANN
        ann_epoch = next((i+1 for i, acc in enumerate(ann_test_acc) if acc >= threshold), min_epochs)
    except:
        ann_epoch = min_epochs
        
    try:
        # For SNN
        snn_epoch = next((i+1 for i, acc in enumerate(snn_test_acc) if acc >= threshold), min_epochs)
    except:
        snn_epoch = min_epochs
        
    ann_epochs_to_converge.append(ann_epoch)
    snn_epochs_to_converge.append(snn_epoch)
```
